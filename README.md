# 100-days
Archive of my first attempt at writing.

## Contents

I was inspired by the [100 Day Writing Challenge](https://listed.to/@Listed/5202/100-day-writing-challenge) on [Listed](https://listed.to/) to improve my writing skills. Though the journey only lasted for 61 days, you can find all the posts [here](https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/100-days/tree/master/archive) or in a blog repository [here](https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/HUGO.386/tree/master/content/blog).
